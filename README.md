Guideline on tools and libraries we use to build NodeJS Web Apps


DESIGNING 
1) Figure out the screen first. Look at the logic, layout and UX. Get this working first. Don't focus on color, using fancy UI components. 
2) Communicate! 
3) Focus on the main flow (normal scenerio). Don't worry about the exceptional cases or fail scenerios. 
4) write up a test case document (use template by George) to handle all the test cases
5) Now handle those cases in your screen. This is client-side validation.
